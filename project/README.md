# Blockchain-Based Certificate Generation & Validation System

A secure, decentralized system for issuing, managing, and verifying certificates using blockchain technology.

## Features

- **Immutable Certificates**: Store credentials on a blockchain to prevent forgery
- **Instant Verification**: Enable quick validation via QR codes or blockchain lookups
- **Decentralized & Secure**: Reduce reliance on centralized authorities
- **User-Controlled Access**: Allow individuals to share their certificates securely

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Blockchain Core**: A Python implementation of a blockchain for storing certificate data
2. **Certificate Management**: Tools for creating, issuing, and revoking certificates
3. **Verification System**: Methods to verify certificate authenticity
4. **Web Interface**: Flask-based web application for user interaction

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Flask and other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000

## Usage

### For Issuers (Universities, Educational Institutions)

1. Register as an issuer
2. Create and issue certificates to recipients
3. Manage and revoke certificates if needed

### For Recipients (Students, Professionals)

1. Register as a recipient
2. Receive certificates from trusted issuers
3. Share certificates with employers or institutions

### For Verifiers (Employers, Organizations)

1. Verify certificates using the certificate ID or QR code
2. Access the verification API for automated verification

## API Reference

The system provides a RESTful API for certificate verification:

- `GET /api/certificates/<certificate_id>`: Verify a certificate by ID

## Security Features

- **Blockchain Immutability**: Once issued, certificates cannot be altered
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Each certificate has a unique hash
- **Revocation Capability**: Issuers can revoke certificates if necessary
- **User Authentication**: Secure login for all users

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
